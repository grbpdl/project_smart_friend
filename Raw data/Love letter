My dear,

I am not very good at expressing my feelings in words, even though I assure you, I am quite a sensitive person. Somehow, often I get shy and run out of words even before I start talking.
However, I now want to tell you about my feelings.

We have been seeing each other for a while and I realize that the more I see you, the more I want to be with you. You are like a beacon of light in a starless night and I am drawn to you with a powerful pull that I can’t resist.
When I am not with you, I keep thinking about you and my day is rather empty. I find myself looking forward to our next meeting.
Yes, I realize now that I care for you very much and my feelings for you have awakened and are getting stronger and stronger each day.
I am starting to fall in love with you and my heart is fluttering every time I am near you … I just hope you have the same sensations and feelings as I do.

I just wanted to write my thoughts down and secretly send this love letter to you.

I am yours, forever …

PS:Have the guts and be positive,fordward this love mail to your crush!Wishing you best of luck!
